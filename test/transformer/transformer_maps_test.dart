/// (or just ahead of) the normal [DateTimeRule]. But when we read back
/// we have no information in the string itself that tells us it's to be
/// parsed as a date, so we need to handle that in the containing object.
/// We pretend that our main rule, [ThingWithDateSerializatinoRule] is generated
